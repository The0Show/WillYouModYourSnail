## Manual Setup

If you really want to use it now, here's how to set it up.

First, and this is important, **install GMML into your Will You Snail game directory**! The setup process is completely broken, so it won't do it for you!

[Click here for a link to the latest version.](https://github.com/cgytrus/gmml/suites/6701126385/artifacts/254714050) Just open the zip and copy it's contents into your Will You Snail game directory (where `Will You Snail.exe` is inside of).

Now, launch the application. You should see this:

Unfortunately as previously stated, the setup process doesn't work. At all. So, we're going to have to go in manual mode.

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd> to open DevTools. Then, go to `Application` > `Local Storage` > `file://`. You should see this:

As you can see, it's already filled out the default setting values for most of the config. All we need to do is specify the game directory.

Copy the path to your Will You Snail game directory (again, the one where `Will You Snail.exe` is inside of), and set it as the value of `gameDir`. It should look something like this:

Now, we're all setup! The last thing we have to do is exit this screen. There's two ways to do it:

### Restart the app (the "i'm too lazy to deal with the console today" method)

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>. This will restart the app instantly.

> **Quick Tip**
>
> This is one of the many shortcuts I've added into the app. Here's the rest of them:<br />
>
> - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> | Reloads the current page. Useful for testing changes to the page or it's preload scripts.
> - <kbd>F8</kbd> | Opens the issue reporter in your default browser.
> - <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F8</kbd> | Opens your file browser, and highlights the current log file.

If all goes well, you should be brought to the `Mods` page.

### Switch to the page via console (the "i'm not lazy" method)

Switch to the `Console` tab in DevTools and run the following command:

```js
window.location.href = "mods.html";
```

No matter which method you use, you can test your game directory by going to the settings page. If it's invalid, it'll probably crash since it can't read your color schemes.

If you have any questions, you can ask me on DMs, issues, or discussions. Have fun!
